   For easy configuration, the default settings enable parameter storage in EEPROM.
   This means, after the first upload many variables can only be changed using the special
   M commands as described in the documentation. Changing these values in the configuration.h
   file has no effect. Parameters overridden by EEPROM settings are calibration values, extruder
   values except thermistor tables and some other parameter likely to change during usage
   like advance steps or ops mode.
   To override EEPROM settings with config settings, set EEPROM_MODE 0

    If you don't feel like computing the table on your own, you can use this generic method. It is

    values in the datasheet. You can increase precision if you use a temperature/resistance for
    R0/T0, which is near your operating temperature. This will reduce precision for lower temperatures,
    which are not really important. The resistors must fit the following schematic:
    @code

    +------ R1 -------+
    |                 |
    +---- Capacitor --+
    |
    V measured
    @endcode

    If you don't have R1, set it to 0.
    The capacitor is for reducing noise from long thermistor cable. If you don't have one, it's OK.
