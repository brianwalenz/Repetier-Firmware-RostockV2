   For easy configuration, the default settings enable parameter storage in EEPROM.
   This means, after the first upload many variables can only be changed using the special
   M commands as described in the documentation. Changing these values in the configuration.h
   file has no effect. Parameters overridden by EEPROM settings are calibration values, extruder
   values except thermistor tables and some other parameter likely to change during usage
   like advance steps or ops mode.
   To override EEPROM settings with config settings, set EEPROM_MODE 0

  This method measures at the 3 probe points and creates a plane through these points. If you have
  a really planar bed this gives the optimum result. The 3 points must not be in one line and have
  a long distance to increase numerical stability.

  BED_LEVELING_METHOD 1
  This measures a grid. Probe point 1 is the origin and points 2 and 3 span a grid. We measure
  BED_LEVELING_GRID_SIZE points in each direction and compute a regression plane through all
  points. This gives a good overall plane if you have small bumps measuring inaccuracies.

  Bending correcting 4 point measurement. This is for cantilevered beds that have the rotation axis
  not at the side but inside the bed. Here we can assume no bending on the axis and a symmetric
  bending to both sides of the axis. So probe points 2 and 3 build the symmetric axis and
  point 1 is mirrored to 1m across the axis. Using the symmetry we then remove the bending
  from 1 and use that as plane.
