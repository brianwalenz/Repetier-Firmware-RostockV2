   For easy configuration, the default settings enable parameter storage in EEPROM.
   This means, after the first upload many variables can only be changed using the special
   M commands as described in the documentation. Changing these values in the configuration.h
   file has no effect. Parameters overridden by EEPROM settings are calibration values, extruder
   values except thermistor tables and some other parameter likely to change during usage
   like advance steps or ops mode.
